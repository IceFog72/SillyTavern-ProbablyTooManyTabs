## v0.11.0 — 2026-05-05

*Unified Tab Strip Modes & Layout Editor UX*

- ✦ New · **Tab Strip Mode** setting introduced, replacing the old Auto-Hide checkbox. Features three states: **Normal**, **Auto-Hide**, and **Shy**.
- ✦ New · **Shy Mode** — minimizes the tab strip to a thin indicator bar *even when the pane is collapsed*. Hovering the indicator brings the tab strip out as a sleek floating overlay.
- ✦ New · **Layout Editor Indicator Icons** — pane titles now display a row of subtle icons indicating their active settings (Expanded/Collapsed Orientation, Flow, Icons Only, Tab Strip Mode) at a glance.
- ✦ New · Replaced the right-click "Auto-Hide" toggle on tab strips with a **Cycle Tab Strip Mode** button (Normal → Auto-Hide → Shy).
- ✦ New · Redesigned the Layout Editor with a modern glassmorphism aesthetic and interactive hover states for config buttons.
- ✔ Fix · **Panel Drift** — resolved an issue where layout columns would micro-shift by a few pixels on each collapse-expand cycle due to splitter widths (6px) not being correctly factored into the flex basis calculation.
- © Integration · Automated background migration smoothly converts legacy `tabStripAutoHide` settings to the new `tabStripMode` format.

## v0.10.6 — 2026-05-01

*World Info Status Bar*

- ✦ New · **World Info Status Bar** — Shows active World Info entries
- © Integration · Based on [SillyTavern-WorldInfoInfo](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WorldInfoInfo) by LenAnderson

## v0.10.5 — 2026-04-29

*Layout Integrity · Context Menu UX*

- ✔ Fix · Switching back from Mobile Layout to Desktop Layout no longer leaves tabs in icon-only mode (missing text)
- ✔ Fix · Users already affected by the broken-save bug are auto-healed on next load via snapshot v19→v20 migration — `showIconsOnly` is now stored in each layout snapshot so desktop and mobile layouts always restore their own correct tab-label state
- ✦ New · Per-pane **Icons Only** and **Auto-Hide Tab Strip** toggles in the right-click context menu are now disabled (greyed out) when the respective global setting is ON, with a tooltip explaining the global override
- ✦ New · Same global override lockout applied in the **Edit Pane** dialog — fields show *(Global)* suffix and are non-interactive when the global setting controls them

---

## v0.10.3 — 2026-04-25

*Code Quality & Correctness*

- ✔ Fix · Auto-hide tab strip now uses the shared unified body observer instead of a separate subtree watcher (performance)
- ✔ Fix · `onEnable` lifecycle hook now reloads the page so the layout is fully restored after a disable/enable cycle
- ✔ Fix · Background color fallback corrected (was briefly applying a bright purple on fresh installs)
- ✔ Fix · Removed ~80 lines of dead code from Settings Panel — orphaned duplicate CSS overrides section
- ✔ Fix · Removed excessive console.log calls that fired on every tab click/collapse/open
- ✔ Fix · `manifest.json` now declares `minimum_client_version` for clearer compatibility errors

---

## v0.10.1 — 2026-04-22

*Icon Sync · Drag Polishing*

- ✔ Fix · Layout editor drag clones are now visually stable, matching the main drag feel
- ✔ Fix · FontAwesome icons with multiple classes (e.g., `fa-regular fa-user`) no longer throw DOM errors
- ✔ Fix · Missing icons restored for tabs using `id:` or `class:` mapping prefixes (Gallery, Avatar, etc.)
- ✔ Fix · Legacy snapshots now correctly migrate updated titles and icons for "API Sliders" and "Characters" tabs
- ✔ Fix · Fallback icon `fa-tab` replaced with `fa-layer-group` across the extension
